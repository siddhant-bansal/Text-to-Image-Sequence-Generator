Jack was a young boy.
He and his poor mother owned a cow.
One morning, mother asked Jack to sell the cow.
Jack visited the market and met a man.
Jack sold the goat and got some beans from the man. 
Then Jack went home. 
When Jack's mother saw the beans she was very angry.
She threw the beans out of the window. 
The next morning, Jack looked out of the window. 
There was a giant beanstalk. 
He climbed up to the sky through the clouds. 
Jack saw a beautiful castle. 
He went inside. 
Jack heard a voice.
The giant was yelling at Jack. 
Jack ran into a cupboard. 
An enormous giant came into the room and sat down. 
On the table there was a hen and a golden harp. 
The giant hit the hen. The hen laid an egg. 
It was made of gold. Giant rubbed the harp. 
The harp began to sing. 
Soon the giant was asleep.  
Jack jumped out of the cupboard. 
He took the hen and the harp. 
Suddenly, the harp shrieked for help.  
The giant woke up and shouted at Jack. 
Jack ran and started climbing down the beanstalk. 
The giant came down after him. 
Jack called mother for help. 
Jack's mother took an axe and chopped down the beanstalk. 
The giant fell and crashed to the ground. 
Nobody ever saw him again. 
With the golden eggs and magic harp, Jack and his mother lived happily ever after.
